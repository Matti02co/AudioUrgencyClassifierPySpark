# AudioUrgencyClassifierPySpark
This project builds a custom dataset of 300 audio clips (with and without urgency), extracts acoustic and textual features (MFCC, RMSE, pitch, TF-IDF), and trains three models from PySpark MLlib(Random Forest, Logistic Regression, GBT). Achieved up to 100% accuracy in urgency detection using combined audio and transcript features.
